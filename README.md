# StefFly-Rotary-Mouse
Arduino file(s) for the SteFly rotary encoder for OpenVario

Work here is based on the .ino files provided by Stefan Langer at https://www.stefly.aero/2019/11/28/custom-user-input-options-for-stefly-rotary-module/

I have adapted (and slightly cleaned up) the original .ino file for rotary plus mouse. Adaptation is primarily around debouncing the rotary encoders.
Cleanup covers mostly code fragments oviously left over from some previous versions of the file(s)

Use at your own risk.
